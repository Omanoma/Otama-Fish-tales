    speech: You tell him of fireflies and summer nights. His gaze lingers, soft as
      the starlight above
  - character: 2
    speech: "When I was little, summers felt endless. I\u2019d chase fireflies in
      the fields near my home\u2026 My mother used to laugh when I came back with
      a jar full of them. She\u2019d say it looked like I was carrying the stars
      themselves."
  - character: 3
    speech: Kael tilts his head, eyes fixed on yours. His fins twitch faintly, betraying
      curiosity.
  - character: 2
    speech: "I\u2019d hold the jar up to my face and pretend I was lost in the night
      sky. The fireflies always escaped in the end\u2026 but for a moment, I thought
      I was holding the universe in my hands."
  - character: 3
    speech: Silence. The waves hush against the sand. Then Kael breathes out a low,
      almost reverent sound
  - character: 1
    speech: "Your eyes\u2026 brighter than these stars."
